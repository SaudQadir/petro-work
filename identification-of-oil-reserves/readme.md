- [x] Compare Two Reservoir Data to make a decision that which reservoir is better 

The Program takes Input as follows :
- Height
- Depth
- Radius
- Grain Volume
- Saturation of water
- Formation Volume Factor
- API Gravity
- Standard cubic feet of gas dissolved
- Percentage of C7 + Molecules
- Estimated Area covered by the reservoir

## Manual
- First of all you have to enter the data of reservoir. It should be in suitable unit.
- Then the Program will ask you to select the desired operation among 5 operation.
- You will select the desired operation like1 for identification of reservoir, 2 for Number of reserves of oil, 3 for number of reserves of gas, 4 for stock tank barrels & 5 for -evaluation of 2nd reservoir.
